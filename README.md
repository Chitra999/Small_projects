28-05-2023 -> This day I created Lorenz Attractor on Python using pygame package. I learnt how differential equations are used in the code.
31-05-2023 -> Today, I learnt how can I create random bars chart animation using random samples and pygame package. I learned how to map data values to graphical                   elements accurately, such as bar heights, widths, and colors.
